GoFullTextSearch is a Go program built to test Bleve Full text search. Solr and Elasticsearch are the most used big scale alternatives but they are also taking quite much memory and resources. <br/>

Welcome Bleve! Bleve is much more light weight solution than it's rivals. It's done with Go and the database can be chosen. The default is BoltDB, but others can be used too, for example SQlite (https://medium.com/developers-writing/full-text-search-and-indexing-with-bleve-part-1-bd73599d82ef#.xi7gtbinb)
